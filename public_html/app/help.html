            Communities:
            Is there something that you're really passionate about or an activity that you enjoy? Well look no further, as Sociable has Communities! Communities are groups that anyone with common interests can join and users of such communities can create posts related to the comunity to show off to others in the community.
            To join a community, navigate to the "Search" section of Sociable and search for the community you would like to join. From there, you can join the community and upon doing so, you will be able to post things within the community that only other community members will be able to view.

            Searching for Users and Communities:
            To find your friends Sociable, use the search feature to search for their username. From there, if they show up in the search results, head back over to your friends page and send them a friend request! Alternatively, to find communities,
            use the search feature and tick the "communities" option to search for a specific community that you would like to join. From there, you will be able to view the community's page and join it to view its posts.
